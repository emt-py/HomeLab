# Home Lab

My Home lab setup and configuration begins with me purchasing a Geekom Mini11 Air Mini PC to use as a home server.

Initially the PC was configured with the Windos 11 OS on a 256GB M.2  SSD and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, but that was quickly replaced with a new 1TB SSD. 
Since the Geekom Mini11 supports dual-channel memory, I upgraded the RAM with two 16GB modules.

With hardware upgrades out of the way, I flashed the Ubuntu Server 24.04 ISO to the new SSD.
